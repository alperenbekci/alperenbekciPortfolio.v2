        I started my career in sales and marketing. Leveraging my e-commerce
        experience, I switched to software development. My journey started with
        front-end development and then I branched out into back-end development
        and eventually became a full-stack developer.

        By adopting the developing technologies in the Web3 world, I turned to
        this field and started creating projects for WEB3 with
        <span className="font-bold "> Trio Blockchain Labs</span>. As my
        knowledge of Web3 continued to grow, I began to use it for investments
        and advisory services, portfolio management and partnerships.
